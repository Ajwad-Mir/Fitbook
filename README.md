In this age, fitness has become the main priority for the people who want to live a long and healthy life. Becoming fit is not only difficult but also sometimes endangering the health of those people who are doing it the wrong way. According to a survey in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese. This means that nearly 64% of the population of the world is overweight and 2.92% of the population is obese.

The main objective of this fitness app is to keep the data of the user’s fitness routine. For example, the number of steps the user has taken and the distance covered by the user.
    The users will be able to do the following;
    Share their own fitness routines with the community
    Save the routine for themselves for later use
    Provide challenges to other users and complete other user’s challenges
